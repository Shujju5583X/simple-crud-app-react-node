## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    # Replace the URL with your own repository's URL
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git)
    cd Your-Repo-Name
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend server and the frontend development server.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *(In your first terminal, from the `backend` directory)*
    ```sh
    node server.js
    # The server will be running on http://localhost:5000
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    *(In your second terminal, from the `frontend` directory)*
    ```sh
    npm start
    # The React application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000
    ```

Now you can interact with the application in your browser!
